# Using whitespaces
Nowadays we always need to leave a plenty of whitespace between elements in the website page. Whitespaces give website elements to be more likely visually and make the website more user-friendly.

# Using compressed images only
Compressed images become very lightweight. Compression helps us to achieve "3 sec" loading or faster.

# Lazy loading
Lazy loading prevents image loading before displaying image element.

# Using breadcrumbs
Breadcrumbs make site-navigation much easier.
